    In 1968, three black girls entered the all-white, sixth-grade classroom at Alex H.	White Elementary School in Pollocksville, North Carolina. Their presence left a	lasting impact on **Jim Grimsley**, a white	boy in that classroom, who found himself confronted with his own ideas about race and difference. Now, nearly 50 years later, Jim Grimsley and those three classmates—**Donnie Meadows, Fernanda Copeland, and Rose Bell**—gather for a conversation about the history that they lived through when Jones County integrated its public schools.
